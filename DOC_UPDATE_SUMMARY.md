## Technical Accuracy Improvements

### Widget Coverage
- **Before**: 13 documented widgets
- **After**: 21 documented widgets (62% increase)
- All widgets in the codebase are now properly documented

### Theme System
- **Before**: Basic mention of "CSS-like styling system"
- **After**: Comprehensive documentation of the CSS selector system, inheritance rules, color variables, and all theming capabilities

### Available Themes

- **After**: 9 utility functions with detailed parameter and usage information

## Verification
- Cross-referenced all documented widgets against actual source files
- Verified theme function names and availability
- Confirmed utility function signatures and capabilities
- Ensured all container types are accurately described

## Impact
The updated documentation now provides:
1. **Complete widget coverage** - no missing widgets
2. **Accurate theming information** - reflects the sophisticated CSS-like system
3. **Comprehensive theme options** - all available themes documented
4. **Enhanced utility coverage** - all helper functions properly described
5. **Better developer experience** - more accurate and helpful package documentation

The documentation now accurately represents the current state of the Zeichenwerk framework and provides developers with complete information about all available functionality.
